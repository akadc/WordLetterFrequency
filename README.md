#Word Letter Frequency

Just having fun trying to make the most efficient algorithm in multiple languages in order to complete the following arbitrary task:

Take a file based string and return the first occurring word in which no other word has a greater frequency of any one letter. 
Display the word, the first-occurring highest frequency letter in the word and the letter frequency.

Languages attempted:

- PHP
- Python
- Go
